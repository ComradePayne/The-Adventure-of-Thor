<h2>The Adventure of Thor</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Surge onward as Thor, using your recovered warhammer Mjollnir to crush the skulls of all who dare resist you!</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player needs a satisfyingly skull-crushing (skull-crushingly satisfying?), bombastic experience.</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Brawler/Beat 'Em Up</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player character is Thor, the Norse God of Thunder (among other things).

    Player Movement:
        Thor can run left, right, up, or down in the play area. Enemies can move too, of course.
    Combat:
        Thor can perform many battle maneuvers. He can execute a furious combo of hammer strikes using the X button, perform a roll-tackle using the Spacebar, or throw his hammer using the 'Z' button. At least, that's what I would've done if I had more time. For now, you can do one attack.
    
        The Combo is good against the hypothetical 'Light' opponents you would face.
        The Roll stuns the Heavy opponents.
        The Throw knocks down the Light opponents, but leaves you vulnerable.
    
        Enemies were supposed to come in two varieties: Light and Heavy.
    
        The Lights have a 2-strike combo, with a gap of 0.5 sec.
    
        The Heavys have a 3-strike combo, with a gap of 1 sec.
    
    There were supposed to be three rooms, the first two with

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
It's an attempt at evaluating brawler style mechanics and more complicated animation, in combination with health mechanics and hit detection. </li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Hypothetically, it'd have a rock-paper-scissors sort of combat mechanic, which seems pretty interesting. </li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This is the world of the Eddas, the Gylfaginning (The Deception of Gylfi), and the Nibelungenlied. Long ago, Odin bore Thor with Frigg, along with many other sons and daughters. Odin and his kin made up the Aesir, the gods of war and civilized arts. Their allies, the Vanir, were nature gods who once warred with the Aesir. 
    
Now, they stand united against the evils of the world. Loki, the hated trickster god, awaits in his prison the day when the giants gather their strength, when Naglfar is completed, when Fenrir breaks from his bonds, when Jormungandr rises from the Great Sea! 
    
Then shall be an axe-age, a sword-age, when Fimbulvetr (The Great Winter) turns father against son, brother against brother, mother against daughter. The earth itself shall shake as the mighty hosts of Odin's Einherjar and the dread hordes of Loki's giant minions meet in the final battle; Ragnarok!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The Frost Giants have long been the foes of the gods, so naturally there have been many skirmishes and feuds between them. Thrym, the mightiest of them, has stolen Thor's hammer Mjollnir and took it to his great hall in Jotunheim. Thor disguised himself as the goddess Freya and, along with Loki, fooled Thrym into giving him his hammer. At that moment, Thor ripped off his dress and began to rampage through Thrym's hall, crushing the skulls of Thrym's sons!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who both enjoy Norse mythology and enjoy brawlers would do well with the hypothetical final product.</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As of now, about five seconds. The finished game would take about five minutes.</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
It would've been good to go for the weaker Light Enemies first, leaving the slower Heavy Enemies for last. </li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Thor, Frost Giant, and Dark Elf sprites are recolored sprites from spritersresource.com
    
The music is "Truth of the Legend" by Kevin MacLeod, downloaded from incompetech.com
    
The background was made by me from scratch, using JPixel. Pretty nice, huh?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It most closely resembles other beat'em up style games, such as Double Dragon or that one Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on the NES.
